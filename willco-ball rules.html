<h1>WillCo-Ball Rules</h1>

<p>The rules are very simple:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The following regular pool fouls result in you instantly losing the game (there are exceptions, see below):
		<ol>
			<li>Potting the white <span class="ball white"></span></li>
			<li>Potting the black <span class="ball black"></span></li>
			<li>Moving balls outside of regular play</li>
			<li>Not hitting any other balls with your cue ball</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Breaking any of the WillCo-Ball rules that have been activated means you lose the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rules are usually activated by potting colour combinations. Combinations consist of all the balls potted in your turn and the previous players turn, even if they lost in that round.</p>
<div class="table">
	<ul>
		<li><span class="ball white"></span> Potting the white on break means the player is not out but has until their turn on the next round to find a substitute cue.</li>
		<li><span class="ball black"></span> Potting the black on break means the player is not out, but that now becomes their cue ball for the rest of the game</li>
		<li><span class="ball orange stripe"></span><span class="ball orange"></span> Two orange balls (Dorito Fingers) means that all players except the one who activated the rule must play with one hand for one round on all shots.</li>
		<li><span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball red"></span> Two red balls (Hells Kitchen) means the player can name a pocket that nobody can pot in, including them. Any player that pots in this named pocket is out, and the pocket is then treated normally for the rest of the game.</li>
		<li><span class="ball purple stripe"></span><span class="ball purple"></span> Two purples balls (Purple Rain) means that all players for one round must play with their weak hand</li>
		<li><span class="ball blue stripe"></span><span class="ball blue"></span> Two blues (Double Denim) means that all players for one round must take shots with their eyes closed, but they may line up shots with eyes open</li>
		<li><span class="ball green stripe"></span><span class="ball green"></span> Two greens () means that the player can place the triangle on the table. Any player that touches it with any balls is out, and the triangle is returned to its normal spot</li>
		<li><span class="ball green stripe"></span><span class="ball green"></span> Potting any green means a player must pot a blue <span class="ball blue stripe"></span><span class="ball blue"></span> if there is one on the table. Failure means the player is out of the game, but potting both means the player can then go for the black <span class="ball black"></span></li>
		<li><span class="ball brown stripe"></span><span class="ball brown"></span> Two browns (Squat Shot) means all players for one round must squat for their shots</li>
		<li><span class="ball yellow stripe"></span><span class="ball yellow"></span> Two yellow balls (Honey Trap) means the next player must take their shot from where they are standing when all balls have come to rest</li>
		<li><span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball blue stripe"></span> Any red and any blue (Police Shot) means all players for one round must take their shots behind their backs</li>
		<li><span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball green stripe"></span> Red and green (Christmas Shot) means the next player must hit the yellow first on their next shot if there is one on the table</li>
		<li><span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball yellow stripe"></span> A yellow and red (Time Bomb) means the next player has 5 seconds from when all the balls have stopped moving to take their next shot. This only lasts for that shot, so if they pot something, play continues as normal</li>
		<li><span class="ball purple stripe"></span><span class="ball blue stripe"></span> A purple and blue (Colour Blind) means that the green <span class="ball green stripe"></span><span class="ball green"></span> and red <span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball red"></span> swap behaviours for the rest of the game or until another Colour Blind is activated. This also means that there is a chance to get double red <span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball red"></span> or double green <span class="ball green stripe"></span><span class="ball green"></span> twice in the same game!</li>
		<li><span class="ball white"></span> Hitting the white so that it touches every single side without touching another ball (Perfect Storm) when there are more than 3 coloured balls on the table allows that player to take a picture of one of the balls whilst every other players' back is turned. Any player which pots this nominated ball is then out of the game.</li>
		<li><span class="ball purple stripe"></span><span class="ball green"></span><span class="ball red stripe"></span><span class="ball blue"></span><span class="ball brown"></span> Potting any 5 regular balls (above rules still apply) in one round means that player can imediately go for the black <span class="ball black"></span>, but only on that round. They also have the opportunity to get an 'out' player back into the game</li>
		<li><span class="ball white"></span> A Cliffhanger is where your shot ends with the white ball overhanging the pocket but don't pot it. When this happens, you get a free card to foul on their next shot (but only that one) and remain in the game</li>
		<li><span class="ball white"></span> If a player is unlucky enough to send the white ball off the table (The Poltergeist), then a player who's out of the game can attempt to catch it and get back in. If the ball flies off the table and lands near a player still in the game and they don't catch it, they're out. Either way, the player who made the shot is out first</li>
		<li><span class="ball white"></span><span class="ball blue"></span> LiveDrive Lucky is when the white and a blue are potted at the same time. If this happens, the player can nominate 5 of the pockets that only they are allowed to pot in for the rest of the game. Like the Hells Kitchen rule, any other player who pots in this pocket is out, and that particular pocket returns to normal</li>
